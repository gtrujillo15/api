RESTful API's are those that fall into the constraints and procedures of a REST API

"How the Web Works"
Browser is a client and it will connect to a server and you'll use a Uniseral Resource Locator (URL) and the url has a scheme portion "http". a protocol is often like a contract. In URI, it's a get that it will receive data. The server will then do the work it needs to do and send back the webpage. The browser then renders the page. HTTP is a stateless protocol. If you use a form, you'll use a post (like php post).

"RESTful API Constraint Scavenger Hunt"

The following constraints determine if an API is RESTful:
- Client-ServerArchitecture
- Statelessness
- Layered System
- Cacheability
- Uniform Design
- Code On Demand

Resources - like a feature

Most of what we want our applications to do with our resources is:
CRUD (Creating Reading Updating Deleting)
